[**LOSE or PAY**](http://loseorpay.herokuapp.com) is the perfect companion app for anyone looking to lose weight who hasn't been able to keep up the needed motivation to stick to his/her diet goals.

Research has proven that there are four main influencing factors that help people to be more disciplined:

> “Think of [these tricks] as insurance against the weaknesses of human nature [...]:
> 
> 1. Make it conscious.
> 2. Make it a game.
> 3. Make it competitive.
> 4. Make it small and temporary.”
> 
> *Tim Ferris, «The 4 Hour Body»*

Our app serves all four and provides even more help.

1. **«Make it conscious»**: The app asks you to commit to an amount that you bet weekly against yourself. You decide whether you risk CHF 10.00 or CHF 100.00 - the more you bet, the more you can lose if you gain weight and the more you can win if you lose weight. We make it very easy for you to start: Let us know your height and weight and we'll take care of the rest. You don't need to let us know your weight goal –  based on your weight & height, we'll set your target BMI and until you are in shape, you're not allowed to quit.

2. **«Make it a game»**: Every Monday it's Weight Time! Hop on your balance and snap a picture with the [**Evernote App**](http://evernote.com). We automatically process your picture and retrieve your current weight. If you weigh more than the week before, you pay the amount you committed and you are reminded to be even more consequent with your dieting goals the week after. 

3. **«Make it competitive»**: The more you bet, the more you can win. The more often you close the week with a lower weight than the week before, the more money you will retrieve! The total amount of money that is paid in by people who have gained weight is distributed among those who have lost weight - on a pro-rata basis dependent on the amount you committed.

4. **«Make it small and temporary»**: After signing up, all you got to do is to snap a picture once a week with the Evernote app. That's all that's needed to stay on track and on top of your weight goals.
It is not important how much weight you loose from week to week, it is only important that you constantly loose weight!

To help you reach that goal, we do not only remind you with emails, we also help you live a healthier lifestyle. Based on your performance, we'll send you dietary plans and recommendations on what to eat. We will save shopping lists for healthy food directly to your [**Evernote app**](http://evernote.com), which you'll always have handy when your in the store doing your shopping. If you prefer to do your shopping online, we'll provide a one-click solution from our website to buy healthy food from **[Migros' leshop.ch](http://leshop.ch)**.
