        <h3>LOSE Weight and get paid doing it</h3>
        <p>Losing weight is hard. And the more you have to lose, the harder it is. After three weeks of fasting, it is just too tempting to celebrate the progress you've made during the past three weeks by treating yourself to a piece of cheesecake or the delicious burger you've been keeping at a safe distance.</p>
        <p><strong>STOP right there!</strong> Losing weight only works if you consistently stick to your goal. It doesn't matter how much weight you lose week to week, it only matters that you constantly lose weight week after week and don't fall back into your old habits. We help you to continuously make the right choice by making it not only fun, but perhaps even profitably.</p>

        <h3>Pay or get Paid - You decide</h3>
        <p>We help you reach a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) in a fun and innovative way. Here's how it works:</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>You tell us your <strong>current weight and height</strong> and we'll tell you your current BMI. You should only use our service if you're overweight.</li>
          <li>You tell us <strong>how much money you want to bet</strong> each week on your own progress. This sum defines how much you'll have to pay to the community pot if you fail to loose weight in a week. It also defines how big your share of the weekly payout will be when you reach your goal and lose weight.</li>
          <li>Every monday we'll ask you to upload <strong>a fresh picture of your scale</strong> via the <a href="http://evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote App</a>. We'll automatically read your current weight and keep it in a log book for you.</li>
          <li><strong>We help you work towards a healthy BMI</strong> by providing you with delicious but healthy recipes - delivered directly to your <a href="http://evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote Notebook</a> including a shopping list - so that you always have the list at your finger tips when you go shopping.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Once you've reached a healthy BMI, you're free to keep monitoring your weight and continue to get free meal plans and recipe recommendations.</p>

        <h3>Questions? We're here to help!</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>When do you charge and pay me?</strong></p>
            <p>When you sign up, we ask for authorization of your credit card for up to four times your weekly commitment. When you lose weight and receive money from other users, we top up your credit. You can always contact our support and have the money wired.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>When does this stop? How do I get out of my commitment?</strong></p>
            <p>We really don't want you to give up and therefore it's quite pricey - only after you do not lose weight in four consecutive weeks, we cancel your account and commitment. We want your weight to drop - not you to drop out! </p>
            <p>Also, if you reach a healthy BMI - anything between 18.5 and 24.9 â€“ you can quit at any time. We also don't want you to drop below 18.5 and we'll automatically suggest to eat more if you get too close to the lower threshold and update your shopping list. Of course, we'll not charge you anything as long as you stay within these bounds.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Can I export my data?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, we'll soon add support to export your data to <%= link_to "Evernote", "http://www.evernote.com" %> notebooks.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>How do you know what's healthy for me and what not?</strong></p>
